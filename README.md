This assignment requires the use a large combination of arrays, for loops, if/if else statements in order to create a functioning quiz that logs and records high scores. The process required a lot of pseudo-coding and outlining to figure out what functions and methods were required in order to execute the quiz. The quiz consists of ten basic coding trivia questions, all multiple choice. When the user clicks an answer, the answer is then verified by the console and recorded as correct/incorrect. After the user clicks an answer, the next question appears until there are no remaining questions. Once the final question is answered, the endQuiz function is ran and the user is prompted to enter their initials to record their score. The score is then printed onto the screen with the corresponding ranking of it compared to previous scores. The real behind the scenes action of this code occurs within the console which checks and records the score. By using the developer tools console tab, you can see the program verifying each answer and executing the proper functions. The code also accesses the local storage in order to use persistance and track high scores.
